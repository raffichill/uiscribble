The purpose of UI Scribble:

When you have an idea for a UI and no pen/paper around, you pop open UI Scribble and capture the thought before it vanishes.

Important specs:

The canvas area has the same aspect ratio as your device, so when you export it will render full-screen and you can see what the shape of the app would feel like in your palm.

The canvas has padding so that you can draw to the edges.

The canvas has rounded corners because iPhones have rounded corners.

Black lines, 2.5px, no color picker.

----------------------------------------------

Needs:

- Improve export (save to photos)
- Bug where single line doesn't get exported
- Line smoothing
- Draw dots
