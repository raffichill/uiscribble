The purpose of UI Scribble:

When you have an idea for a UI and no pen/paper around, you pop open UI Scribble and capture the thought before it vanishes (in the form of a layout).

The canvas area has the same aspect ratio as your device, so when you export it will render full-screen and you can see what the shape of the app would feel like.

The canvas has padding so you can actually draw all the way to the edges.

The canvas has rounded corners because iPhones have rounded corners.

Black lines 2.5px no color picker or anything.

----------------------------------------------

Needs before I'm happy with this app:

- Improve export (save to photos)
- Bug where single line doesn't get exported
- Line smoothing
- Draw dots
